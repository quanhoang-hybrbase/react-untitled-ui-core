# Instruction 1.02: Reflection & Improve

## Checklist for Instruction 1.01

### Step 1: Analyze Component Description
- ✅ Reviewed the Figma Documentation section to understand the component purpose, name, and prop definitions
- ✅ Identified component purpose: A Social Icon is a UI component designed to represent a social media platform or brand logo
- ✅ Identified variant props: format, state, and theme

### Step 2: Scaffold the React Component Folder
- ✅ Created the correct component folder structure: `src/components/element/Icons/E-00-Social-Icon`
- ✅ Created the README.md file with information from the Figma Documentation
- ✅ Added component name and description to the README.md file

### Step 3: Plan Unit Test Cases
- ✅ Generated unit test cases to validate if the component naming is correct
- ✅ Generated unit test cases to validate if the component uses all props names correctly
- ✅ Generated unit test cases to validate if the component uses all props values correctly
- ✅ Included example test code for verifying each prop type and value

### Step 4: Define React Component Props as TypeScript Types
- ✅ Defined the React props for this component in TypeScript types
- ✅ Grouped props into Variant Props, External Props, and Data Props interfaces
- ✅ Followed the "TypeScript Props Type Template" from code-patterns.md
- ✅ Included all props mentioned in the Figma Documentation
- ✅ Used the correct values for each prop as specified in the documentation

### Step 5: Make Request to Figma API of the Component
- ✅ Made the curl request to the Figma API using the provided fileKey and nodeId
- ✅ Used the FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN from the .env file
- ✅ Successfully retrieved and saved the API response

### Step 6: Plan the Component Structure and Variants Configuration
- ✅ Analyzed the API response to understand the component's layer structure and styling
- ✅ Documented the component folder structure in the README
- ✅ Outlined how to define the component in JSX
- ✅ Configured the Tailwind Variants file using the props definitions
- ✅ Included base styling that all variants would inherit
- ✅ Added comments for styling details from the API response
- ✅ Used the correct colors from the Figma API for each social media platform
- ✅ Created proper slot definitions in the Tailwind Variants configuration
- ✅ Followed the JSX structure and Tailwind configuration templates from code-patterns.md

### Step 7: Create Example(s) Usage
- ✅ Created examples of how to use the component with different prop values
- ✅ Included examples for all format variants (F-01 through F-21)
- ✅ Demonstrated usage with different themes (Brand, Gray, White)
- ✅ Demonstrated usage with different states (Default, Hover)
- ✅ Provided examples of usage in different UI contexts (standalone, in groups, in footers)

### Step 8: Confirmation on Next Step
- ✅ Asked for the magic word "ok" to continue with the next instruction

## Requirements Met
All requirements for Instruction 1.01 have been met. The implementation plan includes all the necessary information to prepare for the development of the React component as requested.
