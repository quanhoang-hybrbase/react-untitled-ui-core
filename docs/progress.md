# Work Progress Logs

## 2025-03-15

### Completed
- Initialized Git repository for the project
- Set up remote repository connection to GitHub
- Created project structure following Bulletproof React architecture and Atomic Design principles
- Started implementing the E01-Label component

### In Progress
- Continuing development of core UI components
- Setting up proper documentation for components

### Insights & Learnings
- Following the Atomic Design principles helps create a more maintainable and scalable component library
- Using Tailwind Variants for styling provides a clean way to manage component variants
- Implementing proper TypeScript interfaces from the start ensures type safety throughout the project

## 2025-03-20

### Completed
- Created implementation plan for E-03 Button component based on Figma design
- Defined TypeScript interfaces for component props (VariantProps, ExternalProps, DataProps)
- Configured Tailwind Variants for styling with slots concept
- Structured component JSX according to project template
- Added comprehensive unit tests to validate props usage

### In Progress
- Implementation of the actual component code

### Insights & Learnings
- Proper separation of prop types into logical categories (Variant, External, Data) improves code organization
- Using data attributes for variant tracking helps with both styling and testing
- Tailwind Variants provides a clean way to handle multiple style variations
- Comprehensive unit testing is essential to ensure props are used correctly

## 2025-03-23

### Completed
- Created implementation plan for C-01 Badge Group component based on Figma design and API data
- Scaffolded the component folder structure following project conventions
- Defined TypeScript interfaces for component props (VariantProps, ExternalProps, DataProps)
- Created unit test cases to validate component naming and props usage
- Configured Tailwind Variants for styling with accurate values from Figma API
- Designed component implementation structure with proper hooks
- Added examples of component usage with various prop combinations

### In Progress
- Awaiting approval for implementation of the actual component code

### Insights & Learnings
- Utilizing Figma API data is crucial for accurate styling and structure implementation
- Badge Group as a composite component demonstrates how to effectively compose element-level components
- Proper handling of different layout formats (Leading/Trailing with or without icons) requires careful conditional rendering
- Tailwind Variants' compound variants feature is valuable for handling specific combinations of props
- Following a systematic approach to component implementation planning ensures comprehensive coverage of all requirements

## 2025-03-25

### Completed
- Created implementation plan for E-04 Destructive Button component based on Figma design
- Defined TypeScript interfaces for component props
- Configured Tailwind Variants for styling with slots (base, label, icon)
- Implemented component structure with proper variant handling
- Added comprehensive unit tests to validate all component features:
  - Component naming and export
  - Prop types and values validation
  - Rendering with different variants (format, state, size, icon position)
  - Behavior testing (click events, disabled state, ref forwarding)

### In Progress
- Integrating the E-04 Destructive Button into other components
- Preparing Storybook documentation

### Insights & Learnings
- Proper TypeScript implementation with null checks and type assertions improves component stability
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures component reliability across all variants
- Using Tailwind Variants for complex component styling simplifies maintenance
- Handling icon positioning and accessibility requirements in a consistent manner improves user experience
